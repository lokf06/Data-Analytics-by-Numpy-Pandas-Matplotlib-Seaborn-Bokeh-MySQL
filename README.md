This python code practice is to analyse real-world datasets by using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh and MySQL.
The Bokeh library is used in the Line chart code to create an interactive web-based visualization chart for analysis.
The mysql library is used in the Bar chart code to perform SQL database creation, store, query and retrieve data from relational database MySQL via Docker platform.
Boxplot, Violin chart and Histogram chart will also be created to analyse the dataset.
